                    <p><em>Computer Science and Economics Undergraduate Student at <strong><a
                                    href="https://www.unc.edu/">UNC Chapel Hill</strong></a></em> </p>
                    <p> I am a Senior at UNC Chapel Hill, expecting to graduate in December of 2022, with a demonstrated
                        history of working with a team and establishing on going positive relationships with clients.
                        I am pursing a BS in economics and a BA in Computer Science. I have programming knowledge in
                        Java and Python, and I am currently expanding my knowledge in Web-Development using
                        JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and REACT. I am currently looking to get experience in the
                        Financial Services industry and/or Software Engineering Industry to get exposure to practical
                        applications of my school learning.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Anytime someone asks me the reason behind picking these two majors, I always answer: "I love a
                        competition!" I have played sports since very young, and I have found that my passion for
                        competition transfers into many other areas of my life. I see every programming and economic
                        problem as a challenge, and solving the problem feels like winning. This passion has made me
                        very resilient.
